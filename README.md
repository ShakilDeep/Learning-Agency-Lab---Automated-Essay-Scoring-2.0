The `try.ipynb` notebook provides a comprehensive solution for the Kaggle competition on automated essay scoring. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of its process:

### Data Loading and Initial Exploration
The notebook starts by loading the training and test datasets using `pandas`. It displays the first few rows of the training data to understand its structure.

### Text Cleaning and Feature Extraction
A text cleaning function preprocesses the essays by removing unwanted characters and normalizing the text. The `TfidfVectorizer` converts the cleaned text into numerical features, capturing the importance of words in the essays.

### Feature Engineering
Additional features, such as essay length and average sentence length, are calculated and normalized using `StandardScaler`. These features are combined with the TF-IDF vectors to enhance the model's predictive power.

### Model Training and Evaluation
The data is split into training and validation sets. A `LightGBM` regressor is trained on the combined features, and its performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE). The notebook also explores stacking models, combining `RandomForestRegressor`, `Ridge`, and `LightGBM` to improve predictions.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
`RandomizedSearchCV` is employed to find the best hyperparameters for the `LightGBM` model, further optimizing its performance.

### Prediction on Test Data
The final model is trained on the full dataset, and predictions are made on the test data. The results are saved in a CSV file for submission.

### Advanced Techniques
The notebook incorporates BERT for text feature extraction, significantly enhancing the model's ability to understand and score essays based on their content.

### Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates a robust approach to automated essay scoring, combining traditional machine learning with state-of-the-art NLP techniques. By following these steps, you can achieve high accuracy in predicting essay scores, making it a valuable resource for anyone participating in similar competitions.
